# Zombeats - Bevy Game Jam #3

This is my game entry for the [Bevy Game Jam #3](https://itch.io/jam/bevy-jam-3).

**Zombeats** is a third person, endless survival game with a primary objective of slaying as many zombies as possible.
The settings is staged on a black and white checkered dance floor with upbeat music playing in the background, hence the title, *Zombeats*.

The side effects in *Zombeats* take form of three different *powerups* that the player can pickup: *Stamina Refill*, *x2 Damage*, and *+20 Health*.
